# FriendTodo
This assessment is designed to evaluate the technical and organizational skills of a candidate.

## The exercise
You are a forgetful person. You always forget things to do with/tell to your friends.

For this reason, you decide to write an app that shows the list of your friends and, selecting a friend, the list of things to do with that friend.
 
Your app has to:
- show a list of friends (hardcoded list of people)
- Selecting a friend will list the todo associated with that friend
- You can add a new todo
- You can delete or mark as done the todo

## Bonus point (optional)
 - Use this endpoint to retrieve the list of [friends](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and [todo](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos)
 - Send the todo update to the remote endpoint (see [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/))
 
## FAQ
**Q**: Should I develop it for Android and iOS or use a multiplatform framework?

**A**: You can choose a platform and develop the app for it, the support of both Android and iOS is not mandatory.

## What is being tested?
- Application architecture
- Use of programming patterns
- Use of unit / UX test
- Overall user experience in the application.

## Time requirements
After sending the challenge we'll wait 1 week to hear back from you. Feel free to ask us for any clarification if you need it.

It's okay to leave TODOs or mocks in the code, just explain what you would still finish there if you had more time.
