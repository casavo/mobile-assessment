# FriendFinder
This assessment is designed to evaluate the technical and organizational skills of a candidate.

## The exercise
You want to meet your friends, but you are a lazy person, so you want to know which is the nearest friend to you.

You can see your friends' position from [here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)

The app will show the list of friends sorted by the distance from your current location and the friendâ€™s position. 

Each line is showing the friend's name, its distance from you, and a button to start the navigation to the friend

When a friend is selected, the details are shown:
- Name
- Address
- A button to call your friend
- A button to start the navigation 

## Bonus point (optional)
 - Add the possibility to see the friends' position on a map.
## FAQ
**Q**: Should I develop it for Android and iOS or use a multiplatform framework?

**A**: You can choose a platform and develop the app for it, the support of both Android and iOS is not mandatory.

## What is being tested?
- Application architecture
- Use of programming patterns
- Use of unit / UX test
- Overall user experience in the application.

## Time requirements
After sending the challenge we'll wait 1 week to hear back from you. Feel free to ask us for any clarification if you need it.

It's okay to leave TODOs or mocks in the code, just explain what you would still finish there if you had more time.
